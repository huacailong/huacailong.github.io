      description:
        - Developed algorithm for quantifying errors in non-equilibrium experiments with limited data
        - Validated the algorithm using simulations and experiments by Optical Tweezers via a Python-based toolbox
        - Automated analysis of experimental data with Matlab, reducing processing time from days to two hours
        - Conducted statistical analysis of experimental data to model muscle proteins
        - Developed a physics-based Monte Carlo engine to simulate force spectroscopy data
        - Designed a novel physics-augmented deep learning model to identify single-molecule data, reducing processing to under an hour
