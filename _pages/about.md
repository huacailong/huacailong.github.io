I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Salaphaka Lab](http://salapakalab.ece.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota. I received my Master's degree in Control System with Distinction from Imperial College London. I obtained Bachelor's degrees in Automation Engineering from Politecnico di Milano in Italy and from Electronic Information and Engineering from Tongji University in China. 

My background spans machine learning, large language models (LLMs), signal processing, and data analysis. Specifically, I have developed advanced statistical algorithms to quantify error in non-equilibrium experiments and automated time-series analysis of single-molecule data using a physics-informed deep learning model. During my internship at the University of Phoenix, I fine-tuned LLMs using parameter-efficient methods and deployed chatbots on AWS.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
